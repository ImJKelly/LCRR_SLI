<h1>LCRR & SLI Hub</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The LCRR and SLI hub was created out of necessity. I am part of the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) and Service Line Inventory (SLI) project team
for the City of Vienna (Public Works). During team meetings, confusion among team members in relation to EPA requirements was evident. Members were using
second-hand and outdated resources to relay information. Often, members were unsure of where to get up-to-date and first hand information. The LCRR and SLI hub site 
remedies this problem. The site provides accurate and up-to-date resources for nearly every aspect of the LCRR/SLI project. 

<h2>Skills</h2>
The hub site demonstrates a proficient and skilled use of Project Management, HTML, and CSS, to develope, design, create, and implement a web/intranet site. A problem 
was encountered and a solution was presented.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
  • Visual Studio Code
  • HTML
  • CSS
